            <h3>Site Name</h3>
            <p>Impact Digital Academy</p>
            <p>This name was chosen because it clearly and professionally identifies the business. "Impact" communicates
                the goal of creating meaningful change in students' careers, "Digital" specifies the industry, and
                "Academy" positions it as an educational institution. It's memorable and instills confidence.</p>

                    Marketing Mastery' course, and how will it help me get a promotion?"</li>
                <li>"I'm a career changer with no tech background. Do you offer any beginner-friendly courses, and what
                    kind of support do you provide for job placement after graduation?"</li>
            </ul>
